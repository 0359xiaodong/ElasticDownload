# We are not Gif makers, We are developers
Recently me and my friend came across this cool downloading animation on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/1887815-Download?list=users&offset=4
We found it so cool that we decided to develop it for Android!

We implemented it with a custom view, playing with canvas rotation and path drawing.
